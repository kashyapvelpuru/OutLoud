# OutLoud
Out Loud - Most of us have the ability to voice out our opinion and emotions. 
Have you ever thought what a person who isn't able to voice out his opinion, feelings & emotion would go through? We have and hence our solution.
OutLoud is a platform that aids people facing the disability to speak up and voice out their feelings. Primarily being focussed on patients
suffering from Aphasia. We are planning to expand our project. More updates soon :)
